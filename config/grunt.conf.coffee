  ###
    Global configuration.
    These values are used in 'gruntfile.js', usually for globbing
    patterns. I.e. <%= build_dir %>
  ###
  source_dir: './src/'
  build_dir: './build/'
  compile_dir: './application/'
  ###
    Build configuration.
    The build object below loads the scripts in the provided order
    and writes <script> tags in 'index.html'

    Build scripts should not be minified; this will make it easier
    to debug as we'll see full exception messages in references to
    specific line numbers.

    The CSS files defined here will be concatenated and minified,
    together with the stylesheets present in '/assets'.
    'vendor_css' + 'src/assets' -> build/src/assets/app.min.css
  ###
  build:
    vendor_js: [
      #written in 'index.html' in this order
      './vendor/angular/angular.js'
      './vendor/angular-ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js'
      './vendor/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js'
      './vendor/stacktrace-js/dist/stacktrace.js'
      './vendor/loggly-jslogger/src/loggly.tracker.js'
    ],
    vendor_css: [
      #concatenated with 'assets' stylesheets in 'app.min.css'
      './vendor/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
    ]

  ###
    Compile configuration.
    The compile object is similar to the build one, except it
    contains two Arrays: one for minified scripts and one for
    unminified ones.
    The reason for this is that usually (but not always), Bower
    dependencies also have a minified version of a component,
    therefore there is no reason for us to minify them again.

    Note: This only applies to JavaScript files.
    The same advantages don't really apply to CSS, therefore we
    can include the minified versions in the build object.
  ###
  compile:
    vendor_min_js: [
      #won't minify again
      './vendor/angular/angular.min.js'
      './vendor/angular-ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.min.js'
      './vendor/stacktrace-js/dist/stacktrace.min.js'
      './vendor/loggly-jslogger/src/loggly.tracker.js'
    ]
    vendor_js: [
      #doesn't have a min files, will minify
    ]
  ###
    Common configuration.
    Common resources are vendor (third party) assets that have to
    be included in the project source and are not JavaScript or
    CSS files.

    The common object contains only fonts, but might as well
    contain other assets.
    (Note: if there are other types of assets, then the grunfile.
    js needs to be updated accordingly; there is no task set up
    for other common resources)

    Setting up a new common resource should be done by following
    the fonts implementation in the copy task:

    copy:
    ............................................................
      build_resource:
        src: ['<%= common.vendor_resource %>']
        dest: '<%= build_dir %>src/assets/resource-type/'
        expand: true
        flatten: true
        filter: 'isFile'
    ............................................................

    The task should also be added in the 'build' task:

    grunt.registerTask('build', [
    ............................................................
      'copy:build_resource',
    ............................................................
  ###
  common:
    vendor_fonts: [
      './vendor/bootstrap/dist/fonts/**/*'
    ]
  ###
    The module file order Array.
    As the name suggests, this object is used to dictate a
    certain module file order.

    The order of AngularJS modules is important because the app
    might be easily be broken if a Controller is defined before
    the module that contains it.

    We need to look for both module_js & module_coffee:
      module_js -> used for appending js files to index.html
      module_coffee -> used for globing for source files (by ng-classify)
